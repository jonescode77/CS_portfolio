# CS-210: Module Seven Project

This project tasked me with devloping a program that allowed the management of a grocery store, Corner Groccer, to view the purchase frequency of various items sold.
The main requirements were to read the daily items sold from a text file, and then writing code to allow Corner Grocer to analyze the total amount of each item sold that day.
These include viewing a particular, user-specified item's frequency, viewing frequency for all sold items, and viewing all sold items with their respective frequencies represented by a histogram.

I am satisfied with my function declarations and definitions. I tried to keep each function compact and stick to the needs of the user, without adding complex code that required any extra effort.

I do feel that my code could be enhanced by shedding some of the main() function's code, as some of this could have been cleaner inside of the definitions or header file.

The code that I found most challengin to write was the histogram function, DisplayHistogram(). I spent close to three hours writing this function before realising the solution was a simple for loop inside of the 
cout statement.

What I gained from this project was the experience of being given a specific programming task, with certain requirements and guidelines, and then being able to implement the code how I saw fit.
This creative freedom was exhilirating, as many projects before this one have typically laid out specific UML diagrams or templates to follow as a foundation.
In addition, I felt as though I was a real, professional programmer, working under time constrains to come up with the best possible solution to the requirements laid out to me.

To make the program readable, I made sure to add comments as well as general best practice syntax and naming conventions, both for the user as well as any other programmer who may have viewed the code.
I also tried to make the program maintainable by creating a base class, where the different functions can be called on an object of the class type. This helped with both the functionaliy and the 
end-user experience of the program.
